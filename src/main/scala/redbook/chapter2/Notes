Chapter 1: Functional Programming Basics
    Push side effects to the edge of our programs
        Can we think of any places in our code that produce side effects
        How do we interact with the outside world.
    A pure function is one that lacks side effects
    Referential Transparency - Expression is RT if all occurrences of the expression can be replaced with its evaluated value without affecting the meaning of the program using the expression.
Chapter 2: Getting started with FP in Scala
    A return type of Unit generally indicates a side effect or code smell (same as with void return in Java)
    Higher Order Function (HOF) is a function which accepts other functions as arguments
    Functions in scala are values
    Instead of using loops, try and use tail recursive functions
        Can use @annotation.tailrec to have the scala compiler throw an error if our assumption of tail recursion is not true
        A recursive function that isn't tail recursive has the potential to blow the stack
